🧠 Image Similarity Search using Custom AKAZE and Deep Learning Models
This project focuses on searching for visually similar images using a combination of handcrafted and deep learning approaches. All models, including the feature detector and neural networks, were implemented from scratch — without using OpenCV or pre-built architectures.

🔍 Key Components
🧩 Custom AKAZE Implementation
A full AKAZE (Accelerated KAZE) feature detector built manually in Python, without relying on OpenCV. It includes nonlinear scale-space generation, feature detection, and descriptor computation.

🧠 Simplified Inception-V3
A lightweight version of the Inception-V3 architecture implemented from scratch using PyTorch (or your framework). Adapted for efficient feature extraction from images.

🧬 Siamese Neural Network
Designed to compare image embeddings and determine similarity. Trained on custom or benchmark datasets to learn visual closeness.
